NAME
    Acme::EyeDrops - Visual Programming in Perl

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::EyeDrops qw(sightly);

            print sightly( { Shape       => 'camel',
                             SourceFile  => 'myprog.pl' } );

DESCRIPTION

    Acme::EyeDrops converts a Perl program into an equivalent one,
    but without all those unsightly letters and numbers.

    It supports Visual Programming by allowing you to pour the generated
    program into various shapes, such as UML diagrams, enabling you to
    instantly understand how the program works by glancing at its new
    and improved visual representation.

INSTALLATION
    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file and *.eye files in
    its appropriate local Perl subdirectory.
